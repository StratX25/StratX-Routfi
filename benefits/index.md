# Benefits to Citizens

While StratX and RouteFi are designed for institutions, their ripple effects can positively impact everyday people. By reducing friction and enabling clearer, rules-driven flows, this kind of infrastructure can support:

- **Faster settlement of wages and remittances**, giving people quicker access to their money.
- **Lower fees**, as optimized routing reduces intermediaries and associated costs.
- **More transparent rules**, so consumers know why transactions are allowed or denied.
- **Better access**, enabling more people to participate in global commerce through simplified on-ramps.

These benefits are aspirational: they describe what the system is designed to help achieve, not guaranteed outcomes. By improving efficiency and transparency, such infrastructure may contribute to price stability and ease tensions that sometimes lead to conflict.
