# Use Cases

The StratX and RouteFi stack supports a wide array of applications across public and private sectors. Here are some examples:

## Cross‑Border Payouts

Send money across borders quickly and compliantly. Policies enforce KYC/AML requirements while RouteFi chooses the most efficient rail—bank wire, CBDC, or blockchain—based on cost and speed.

## Treasury Operations

Automate treasury tasks such as payroll, supplier payments, and capital deployment across multiple currencies. StratX ensures policies are applied uniformly; RouteFi executes the flows.

## CBDC Interoperability

Governments can connect national payment systems with emerging CBDCs. StratX sets policy rules for when and how digital currencies can be used; RouteFi ensures interoperability between fiat and digital.

## Real‑Time Compliance

Instant policy enforcement and reporting help institutions meet regulatory obligations without slowing down transactions. Compliance checks happen before settlement, not after.

## Humanitarian Disbursements

Deliver aid directly to recipients without intermediaries. RouteFi selects the fastest and least costly route; StratX ensures funds are used for the intended purpose.

## Public Sector Payouts

Streamline distribution of tax refunds, benefits, or grants. Programmable rules ensure funds go to the right person, at the right time, under transparent conditions.
