  <h1>StratX: The Policy Brain</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    StratX is the orchestration and governance layer of programmable finance.
    It defines <strong>what is allowed</strong> — setting the rules of the game for institutions, governments, and enterprises.
  </p>

<div class="card">
  <h2>What is StratX?</h2>
  <p>
    StratX provides a unified policy and governance engine for global financial flows.  
    It ensures that money moves only within defined guardrails, across legacy systems, CBDCs, and blockchains.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rules before money moves:</strong> Every transaction passes policy checks first.</li>
    <li><strong>Programmable governance:</strong> Regulations and policies are codified into enforceable rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-rail oversight:</strong> StratX ensures consistent compliance across all rails.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Who It’s For</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Governments</strong> — enforce monetary policies and connect CBDCs to global commerce.</li>
    <li><strong>Banks</strong> — operate safely between fiat and digital assets without losing compliance.</li>
    <li><strong>Enterprises</strong> — automate treasury, payroll, and global operations within clear rules.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Key Capabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unified policy engine:</strong> Define once, enforce everywhere.</li>
    <li><strong>Interoperability layer:</strong> Consistent rules across legacy and decentralized systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Audit and reporting:</strong> Real-time logs and cryptographic proofs for transparency.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic rule updates:</strong> Adapt policies instantly without redeploying infrastructure.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Guardrails</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All transactions must pass policy checks before approval.</li>
    <li>Only approved assets and rails are accessible; others are blocked.</li>
    <li>Multi-signature and role-based access prevent single points of failure.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <h2>How StratX Complements RouteFi</h2>
  <p>
    StratX sets the policy. RouteFi enforces it.  
    StratX governs. RouteFi executes.  
    Together, they complete the circle: one defines the law, the other ensures it is always followed.
