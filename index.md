# StratX

StratX is a high‑level orchestration platform that bridges legacy financial rails with the emerging world of programmable finance. It's built for institutions—banks, governments, and enterprises—that need to modernize infrastructure without rewriting the rules of money.

## Who It's For

- **Governments** seeking to connect central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and existing payment systems.
- **Regulated institutions** such as banks and payment providers that need to interoperate with blockchain networks safely.
- **Enterprises** looking to automate treasury operations across fiat and digital assets.

## Key Capabilities

- **Unified policy engine:** Define compliance policies that apply across fiat and blockchain transactions.
- **Interoperability layer:** Connect to legacy payment systems and multiple blockchains with a consistent API.
- **Audit and reporting:** Real‑time visibility into flows, with cryptographic proofs and logs for regulators.

## Guardrails

- Transactions pass through policy checks before settlement.
- Only approved rails and tokens are used; unsupported assets are automatically blocked.
- Multi‑sign controls and role‑based access ensure no single point of failure.

## Outcomes

By providing a programmable layer between old and new rails, StratX aims to help reduce settlement times, increase transparency, and lower operational risk. It is designed to support societal benefits such as easing cross‑border frictions and promoting financial stability—without making promises or guarantees.
