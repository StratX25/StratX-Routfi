# RouteFi: The Execution Layer

If StratX is the “policy brain,” RouteFi is the “muscle.”  
Together they form a programmable infrastructure that keeps the global financial system balanced — connecting institutions, governments, and citizens through rails that work together instead of against each other.

## What is RouteFi?

RouteFi is the **institutional wallet and routing layer**. It is where rules and policies created in StratX are translated into live transactions across fiat networks, CBDCs, and decentralized rails.  

- **Wallet orchestration**: Secure custody and multi-signature controls for institutions.  
- **Routing intelligence**: Executes the most efficient and compliant path for every transaction.  
- **Programmable execution**: Policies aren’t just guidance — they are enforced directly in every flow.

## How RouteFi Complements StratX

- **StratX defines policy.** RouteFi enforces it.  
- **StratX decides what is allowed.** RouteFi ensures it only happens that way.  
- **StratX is governance.** RouteFi is the settlement.  

Without StratX, there is no trusted brain. Without RouteFi, there is no way to enforce decisions in real time. Only together do they **complete the circle** — policy + execution, compliance + liquidity, legacy + DeFi.

## RouteFi’s Role in the Bigger Picture

- **Institutions** rely on it to settle billions securely.  
- **Governments** depend on it to enforce policies in real time.  
- **Citizens** benefit indirectly through faster, safer, and more transparent financial flows.  

StratX sets the rules of the game. RouteFi ensures they’re followed.  
Together, they create the programmable infrastructure that can keep global finance in check while opening the door to fairer, more efficient systems.
