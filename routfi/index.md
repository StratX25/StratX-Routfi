# RouteFi

RouteFi is an institutional wallet and routing layer that manages the flow of funds across fiat and blockchain networks. It sits alongside StratX to execute the routes defined by policy.

## Overview

- **Institutional wallet:** Secure custody for multiple currencies—fiat and digital—under compliance controls.
- **Policy‑aware routing:** Every transfer checks the rules defined in StratX before it proceeds.
- **Orchestration engine:** Automatically chooses the optimal route (legacy, CBDC, or blockchain) based on cost, speed, and regulatory considerations.

## Benefits for Institutions

- **Reduced operational overhead:** Consolidate multiple wallets and bank accounts into a single, policy‑driven system.
- **Enhanced security:** Hardware‑secured signing and multi‑layer authentication.
- **Programmable settlements:** Execute complex flows such as atomic swaps, conditional payments, and escrow.

## Benefits for End Users

- **Faster access to funds:** Payouts clear in minutes or seconds rather than days.
- **Lower costs:** Optimized routing reduces fees across networks.
- **Transparency:** Clear policy rules give confidence that transactions follow the intended path.
